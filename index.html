        <p>My name is Maxim Koltypin, I'm 23 years old and I live in The Netherlands. I enjoy travelling, learning new skills, working out and gaming.
          In my free time you can usually find me in the gym, behind my computer, or spending time with my beautiful girlfriend. Currently I am still in the Dutch Marine Corps (enlisted in 2018)
          and am looking for ways to expand my knowledge and skillset.
          <br><br>
          Thus far I have finished the CS50X and CS50P courses and am currently working on the CS50Web one. I am  really enjoying the courses by Harvard and am planning on following many more courses including CS50AI.
          <br><br>
          Next to this course I am learning and improving my language skills so I can communicate with more people (and of course work in other countries perhaps).

            <p class="paragraph1">
              I have worked at New York Pizza when I was roughly 15 years old where I was hired as a pizza delivery guy at first.
              After a while though management asked me if I would like to broaden my skillset by also working in the kitchen from time to time.
              In the end I worked as an <br>"All-round employee" where I was partially in the kitchen, and at other times delivering the pizza's.
              I enjoyed my time working here and I suffice to say that the management was very happy with me aswell.

            <p class="paragraph2">
              After I left New York Pizza I went to work at Albert Heijn, which is a grocery store chain in The Netherlands.
              I went to work here because a friend of mine recommended it to me seeing as the pay was almost double as previously.
              Needless to say I did not like working here though as the manager and I didn't get off on a strong foot.

              I worked briefly at JD Sports in Amsterdam, Nieuwedijk as a shoe salesman primarily.
              Here I was tasked to sell shoes at the Men's and Women's section and learned valuable skills like communication and negotiating.

              training exercises including Mountain training, Arctic training, Urban terrain and many more.
              In 2021 I was deployed to Iraq for a tour of 4.5 months between may and september for which I was granted a medal.

                <h3>Travel</h3>
                <p>
                  One of my many hobby's is travelling around the world
                  and discovering new places. I've already seen almost all of Europe, I have been to the US multiple times and have even been to Japan.
                  I plan on endulging on many more trips so I can every part of the world before I grow old.

                <h3>Gym</h3>
                <p>
                  Also a hobby that I love to do on the daily is workout in the gym. Here you see a picture of me squatting 130kg's.
                  I do think about fitness more as a lifestyle than a hobby per say as it has become quite important to me, just like with life as a whole, I always strive for 
                  perfection in the gym.

                <h3>Shooting</h3>
                <p>
                  One of the other hobby's that I've always liked doing, but have only started doing more intensively recently, is shooting. As I've been in the Dutch Marine Corps for over 5 years now
                  this has become a rather favorite of mine. So much so that I've even registered myself to a gun club to go and shoot over there in my free time.
