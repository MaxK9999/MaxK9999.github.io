        <p>My name is Maxim Koltypin, I'm 23 years old and I live in The Netherlands. I enjoy travelling, learning new skills, working out and gaming.
          In my free time you can usually find me in the gym, behind my computer, or spending time with my beautiful girlfriend. Currently I am still in the Dutch Marine Corps (enlisted in 2018)
          and am looking for ways to expand my knowledge and skillset.
          <br>
          Thus far I am really enjoying the CS50x course by Harvard and am planning on following many more courses including CS50P, CS50W and CS50AI.
          <br>
          Next to this course I am learning and improving my language skills so I can communicate with more people (and of course work in other countries perhaps).

            <p class="paragraph1">
              I have worked at New York Pizza when I was roughly 15 years old where I was hired as a pizza delivery guy at first.
              After a while though management asked me if I would like to broaden my skillset by also working in the kitchen from time to time.
              In the end I worked as an <br>"All-round employee" where I was partially in the kitchen, and at other times delivering the pizza's.
              I enjoyed my time working here and I suffice to say that the management was very happy with me aswell.

            <p class="paragraph2">
              After I left New York Pizza I went to work at Albert Heijn, which is a grocery store chain in The Netherlands.
              I went to work here because a friend of mine recommended it to me seeing as the pay was almost double as previously.
              Needless to say I did not like working here though as the manager and I didn't get off on a strong foot.

              My current employer, the Royal Dutch Marine Corps is where I am still working to this day. I have worked here since 2018 and have been on multiple
              training exercises including Mountain training, Arctic training, Urban terrain and many more.
              In 2021 I was deployed to Iraq for a tour of 4.5 months between may and september for which I was granted a medal.

                <p>
                  One of my many hobby's is travelling around the world
                  and discovering new places. I've already seen almost all of Europe, I have been to the US multiple times and have even been to Japan.
                  I plan on endulging on many more trips so I can every part of the world before I grow old.

                <p>
                  Also a hobby that I love to do on the daily is workout in the gym. In this provided picture you can see me deadlift 180kg's or 400lbs
                  which is still my all-time personal record. I mainly workout to get stronger and to get in shape.

                <h3>Gaming</h3>
                <p>
                  Here you see my desktop PC that I hand built. Ever since I built this PC I fell in love with PC gaming and all the games that are offered on Steam.
                  To be fairly honest I had never thought that I would use this desktop for anything other than gaming, but when I discovered programming I guess that all changed.
